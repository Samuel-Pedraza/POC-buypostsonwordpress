### Proof of Concept - Buy Posts on a WordPress website

This was a dirty proof of concept idea that I whipped up really quick. It's essentially a theme (should probably be a plugin) that allows you to purchase posts from a website, registers you as a user, and when you hit the amount of posts you've purchased, you cannot purchase anymore.

It would be trivial to allow someone to repurchase an amount of Posts. Please don't kill me over my code. I know it's horrible.
